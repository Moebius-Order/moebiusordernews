  "title": "Infinite Gacha Project Status and Official Clarification",

  "content": "Infinite Gacha is an original project currently under active development and serves as the flagship game initiative of Moebius Order. The project is conceived as a long-term interactive universe, designed around structured systems, expandable gameplay frameworks, and continuity-driven worldbuilding rather than short-term or isolated releases.\n\nIn recent months, misinformation has circulated across various media outlets, automated platforms, and third-party sources claiming that Moebius Order is the official development team behind the manga Pick Me Up. These claims are incorrect. Moebius Order has never stated, implied, or represented itself as the official team responsible for that work. Any such associations are the result of impersonation, misattribution, or incorrect information generated by external systems, including automated content aggregation.\n\nThe Infinite Gacha project draws inspiration from the broader genre and related creative works. Moebius Order has expressed interest in pursuing a formal adaptation only if explicit authorization is granted by the legitimate intellectual property holder. As of January 2026, Moebius Order is not an officially recognized team developing an adaptation of Pick Me Up or any related intellectual property. While outreach and exploratory discussions are ongoing, no agreement, partnership, or authorization has been finalized.\n\nThis update is issued to clearly communicate the current status of the Infinite Gacha project, correct public misinformation, and reaffirm Moebius Order’s commitment to transparency, ethical development practices, and respect for intellectual property rights.\n\nFor further information about the Infinite Gacha project, including official updates and project-specific details, please refer to the dedicated project site at https://ig.moebiusorder.com.\n\nGeneral inquiries regarding this update may be directed to info@moebiusorder.com. Parties interested in intellectual property discussions, licensing, or legal matters related to Infinite Gacha are encouraged to contact legal-team@moebiusorder.com.",
